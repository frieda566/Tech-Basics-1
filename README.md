# Week 1 
This weeks assignment consisted of creating my first **GitHub repository** with a *README.md* file. Additionally, I created a **folder structure** for my assignments. I placed my first Python excercise, which involved creating a piece of *ASCII art* inside the folder. 
If you are interested you can find it under **assignments/ week 1**!
